Hi there! My name is Vignesh Saravanakumar. I have been coding since I was 13 years old and have been passionate about it ever since. I have a repository of all my notes and a repository of Coursera courses I have completed with their certificates attached. I also have a repository of all the projects I have completed at school. I am particularly interested in algorithms, data structures, and artificial intelligence. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. Thank you for taking the time to visit my Github page.
